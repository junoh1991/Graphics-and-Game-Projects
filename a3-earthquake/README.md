# CSci-4611 Assignment 3:  Earthquake
Author: Marcus Oh

Description: This program adds vertices/indices/texture coordinates for both 2d and 3d of the Earth map. The program is able to morph between 2d and 3d earth, which uses Lerp functions to smooth out the transition. Earthquakes are shown in both 2d and 3d map.

Wizard Work: You can drag around the 3d globe to tilt/rotate the globe. The earthquakes will move along with the tilt/rotation.
